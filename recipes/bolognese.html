  <h3>Description:</h3>
  <p>Pasta Bolognese is a classic Italian dish where al dente pasta meets a hearty ground beef sauce slow-cooked with onions, garlic, and tomatoes. The addition of milk helps tenderize the beef and also adds a note of richness to the flavorful bolognese sauce. It’s a family-friendly dinner everyone will love!</p>

  <h3>Ingredient List:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Olive Oil:</strong> You have to use olive oil when making Italian food! Any other oil just won’t cut it.</li>
    <li><strong>Onion, celery, and carrots:</strong> These ingredients form the base of flavor for a lot of your favorite soup recipes, and they do the same in Bolognese sauce.</li>
    <li><strong>Garlic:</strong> You can add more if you’d like, but never add less!</li>
    <li><strong>Lean ground beef:</strong> Because I don’t drain off the grease in this recipe, I recommend a lean ground beef to keep the sauce from being too greasy.</li>
    <li><strong>Whole milk:</strong> I recommend sticking with whole milk, rather than swapping in a lighter version. It adds a lot of richness to the sauce.</li>
    <li><strong>Crushed tomatoes:</strong> Crushed tomatoes give us more texture than canned tomato sauce, but they’re more broken down than diced tomatoes. This makes them perfect for pasta sauce.</li>
    <li><strong>Tomato paste:</strong> Tomato paste isn’t just to intensify the tomato flavor; it also adds umami.</li>
    <li><strong>Seasonings:</strong> You’ll need the standard salt and pepper, along with a bay leaf, oregano, and nutmeg.</li>
    <li><strong>Tagliatelle pasta:</strong> Or your pasta of choice.</li>
    <li><strong>Chopped parsley:</strong> For garnish.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Recipe Steps:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Sweat the onions, celery, carrots, and garlic in a large pot on the stovetop.</li>
    <li>Add the ground beef and season with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Break up the beef and cook until it’s browned, stirring occasionally.</li>
    <li>Stir in the milk and simmer until it mostly evaporates.</li>
    <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and remaining seasonings.</li>
    <li>Bring the mixture to a boil, then simmer on low, uncovered, until the sauce is <span class="thick">thick</span> and flavorful.</li>
  </ol>
