# odin-recipes
This project is meant to showcase a few recipes that can spice up your everyday meals. Links will be included and feel free to add any recipes you like in order to contribute and take this to the next level. Let him cook!

By the end of this project, I will learn how to use basic HTML and eventually basic CSS to create and style a simple webpage that utilizes the foundational skills of a full stack/web developer, ensuring I know the fundamentals such as the html template, links, images, and so on.
